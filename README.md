## Problem Statement

**Project Overview:**

Determining car prices in the automotive industry involves various factors such as brand reputation, car features, horsepower, and fuel efficiency. Car price prediction is a key application of machine learning. This project aims to teach you how to build a car price prediction model.

**Key Objectives:**

- Explore the factors influencing car prices.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict car prices.
- Gain valuable experience in machine learning and automotive pricing.

## Project Summary

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various influencing factors.

Why Car Price Prediction? Car prices are influenced by numerous variables, including brand reputation, features, horsepower, and fuel efficiency. Machine learning models can provide accurate price predictions.

Key Tasks:

- Data Collection: Gather data on various car attributes and their corresponding prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Identify the most important features for price prediction.
- Model Building: Create a machine learning model capable of predicting car prices.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.
- Deployment: Make the trained model available for car price predictions.
- Benefits: By completing this project, we'll gain valuable insights into machine learning, data analysis, and the automotive industry. We'll also have a functional car price prediction model that can be useful for future car pricing decisions.

## Results

I have chosen the R2 score as the primary evaluation metric for the Car Price Prediction model. After eliminating overfitted models with 100% MSE, R2 score, and Adjusted RÂ² score on the training set, as well as models with negative accuracy values, the final list is as follows:
|Sl. no.| Regression Model         | R2 Train(%) | R2 Test(%) |
